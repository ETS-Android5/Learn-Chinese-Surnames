# Learn-Chinese-Surnames
Code for the Android Application, Learn Chinese Surnames. The application won the first prize of Shanghai Library Open Data Application Development Contest in 2016, see [```website```](http://pcrc.library.sh.cn/zt/opendata/2016/) in Chinese.

Detail of the application has been documented in the papers below:
* Enrichment of Cross-Lingual Information on Chinese Genealogical Linked Data, in iConference 2017 Proceedings. [```pdf```](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/98870/2pt3_Dong-Enrichment.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
* Matching Linked Data for Cross-Lingual Genealogical Services——Learn Chinese Surnames in Shanghai Library Open Data Application Contest. Journal of Academic Libraries [in Chinese], 2018-04. [```pdf```](http://162.105.140.111/sites/default/files/attachment/dxtsgxb/donghang.pdf)

The application that fully supports older versions (android 4 and 5) is in the file [```Learn Chinese Surnames - Android 4-5.zip```](https://github.com/acadTags/Learn-Chinese-Surnames/blob/master/Learn%20Chinese%20Surnames%20-%20Android%204-5.zip). [```Screenshots```](https://github.com/acadTags/Learn-Chinese-Surnames/tree/master/app%20screenshots) are available for this version.

The application is now suitable for Android 9 and later versions. There are still some issues (to fix, would need some help, if possible):
1. fail to load the image characters.
2. fail to display pinyins of the places of the family books.

Apk files of different versions are available at [```apk for Android 4-5```](https://github.com/acadTags/Learn-Chinese-Surnames/blob/master/Learn%20Chinese%20Surnames%20-%20Android%204-5.apk) and [```apk for Android 9+```](https://github.com/acadTags/Learn-Chinese-Surnames/blob/master/Learn%20Chinese%20Surnames%20-%20Android%209%2B%20(beta).apk).
